        <h2>43 Small Bathroom Ideas to Make Your Bathroom Feel Bigger</h2>
        <p>
            Looking for small bathroom ideas that will make the space seem larger than life? So is most of New York
            City. The lack of square footage, limited natural light, and number of fixtures to squeeze in make a small
            bathroom one of the more challenging spaces to decorate. But when done right, the whole room can seem
            brighter and more spacious. And no, you won’t have to spend a zillion dollars to carve a window into the
            wall (or call on something retro like glass bricks).

            These small bathroom ideas go beyond making the most of the available space and prove that bold design
            elements can be right at home in even the tiniest rooms. Here are the best ways to turn powder rooms,
            half-baths, and just little tiny (sometimes windowless) bathrooms into less cramped, more enjoyable
            situations. Your small bath may just be your next favorite room.
        </p>
        <h2>Keep Your Colors Light and Bright</h2>
        <p>
            A wood floor and vanity give this city bathroom a warm and serene feeling. A soft mint green hue reflects
            natural light from the window. The space surrounding the freestanding tub makes the room feel more open, as
            does the lightweight curtain fabric, which allows maximum light to enter.
        </p>
        <h2>Or Double Down With a Dark Color Scheme</h2>

        <p>
            Wait, what? “Oftentimes I like to paint small bathrooms [typically windowless rooms] a dark color, like
            black. It gives depth and creates an illusion of a larger space,” says Jenny Wolf of Jenny Wolf Interiors.
            “Go with a high-gloss in a super dark color,” advises Fleming James of Oliver Street Designs. The hue will
            simultaneously impart a big-night-sky effect and also bounce the little light you have around the space.
            (Doing so will also draw attention to the light fixtures, she points out, so you’ll need to choose them
            thoughtfully—bulbs that bring in plenty of light, shapes you don’t mind being pretty pronounced.)
        </p>
        <h2>Mirror a Wall</h2>

        <p>
            Rather than just hanging one above the vanity, consider mirroring a whole wall of your tiny bathroom. The
            reflection of light and pattern (and, sometimes, that open door) will do the same good work a window does.
            Another major space saver? A shower niche. If you’re designing a small bathroom, make sure to include a
            shower niche in your plans. If you’re designing your tiny bathroom from scratch (or remodeling), a tiny
            corner sink may be among the most handy simple small bathroom ideas. There’s no rule that says you have to
            have a full-size standard sink. A corner sink gets the job done just as well—plus it gives you plenty of
            space and less to clean.


        </p>
        <h2>Opt for a Glass Shower Door</h2>

        <p>
            If you’re starting your small bathroom design from scratch, consider scrapping the curtain entirely. “I also
            recommend glass shower doors in a small bath, as it will help to open up the space,” Wolf says.
            Covering the floor with a bathroom vanity or storage containers can create a cramped space, not to mention
            tripping hazards. A pedestal or floating vanity keeps the floor clear, and installing floating storage will
            help keep everything you need at arm’s length.
            Believe it or not, this bathroom is windowless. Tall mirrored medicine cabinets and a glass shower amplify
            light from the interior fixtures, brightening up the space. Wolf used built-in cabinets to save floor space.
            A herringbone wood floor gives the illusion of a larger and warmer bath.
        </p>
        <h2>Or Remove Your Shower Door Completely</h2>
        <p>
            The slightly more adventurous might even consider no shower door at all (a good drain is wise in that case).
            This can be a chic and modern way to amplify light,” James says, “if you do not have room for sconces or
            simply want a more minimalistic look.” Tile is a durable way to add impact and can be used from floor to
            ceiling. “For smaller bathroom walls, we like to specify ceramic tiles that are small,” says Suzanne McGrath
            of the design firm McGrath II. The designer is a fan of using one-by-four and two-by-six floor tiles—which
            are also less expensive—on bathroom walls.
        </p>
        <h2>Give the Curtain a Lift</h2>
        <p>
            If you have the luxury of choosing where your shower curtain goes, James recommends that you “take the
            fabric all the way up” past the usual height of the tub. “Extending the curtain nearly to the ceiling will
            certainly elongate the walls,” she says, adding that the taller your ceiling, the more this will help. The
            ceiling curtain track in designer Ryan Brooke Thomas’s own apartment does just that.
        </p>
        <h2>Choose Compact Pieces</h2>
        <p>
            Hulking vanities and blocky tubs may look at home in a larger bathroom, but they can make a small bathroom
            feel claustrophobic. Install compact toilets and sinks or consider floating versions to open up the space,
            like in this 650-square-foot apartment designed by Brett Masterson. If a tub is a must, consider a Japanese
            soaking tub to add serenity without taking up square footage.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Modern luxury bathroom interior design is not just about spending more money and adding irrelevant
            embellishments. It is about space planning, choice of furnishings and fittings, and how all these actions
            are executed. The idea is to mix and match vintage elements with contemporary design concepts, and also to
            exploit materials which are rich to look and feel. De-cluttering is yet another factor which simply cannot
            be ignored. A minimalistic bedroom is in itself a symbol of “Luxury”.
