        <h2>Furnish small bathrooms and create size in the process</h2>
        <p>
            Designing a small bathroom requires observation of the laws of visual perception. Open, continuous surfaces
            appear much larger than divided spaces. In concrete terms, this means using the same tiles on the floor and
            walls, creating uniformity that gives the impression of spaciousness.
        </p>

        <h3>Bathroom ideas for a small bathroom – Play with light</h3>
        <p>
            Bright colors will immediately make any room look larger. It's recommended you use dark tones sparingly in a
            small bathroom, in the accessories for example. Mirrors can also make a small bathroom feel bigger, so it’s
            worth asking yourself if you can accommodate more mirrored surfaces in your bathroom, in addition to a
            mirror cabinet.
        </p>
        <p>
            You should also ensure optimal illumination. Daylight is ideal. You can brighten an interior bathroom with
            artificial light that provides a daylight spectrum. In a small bathroom, space-saving ceiling spots are a
            good choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Smart lamps can be controlled with your smartphone as needed, allowing you to shine all the colors of the
            rainbow in your bathroom, in addition to daylight. Research has shown that we prefer colder-colored light in
            the morning, and warmer light in the evening. Take a look at our article on bathroom lighting for additional
            ideas.
        </p>
        <h3>Bath tub or shower?</h3>
        <p>
            Are regular baths part of the good life for you? So-called space-saving bath tubs, which take account for
            the natural shape of the human body, are a good choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you can do without a bath tub, a floor-level shower with glass walls will fit into any small bathroom. It
            also offers the advantage of making your bathroom barrier-free.
        </p>
        <p>
            Underfloor heating is also suitable for a small bathroom. It can often be easily implemented during a
            bathroom renovation. If this isn't possible, opt for a narrow towel radiator that can also serve as a towel
            bar.

        </p>
        <h2>Comfort and function combined with coziness in the small bathroom</h2>
        <p>
            When you're designing a small bathroom, the materials you use are twice as important. Luxurious tiles,
            ideally in large dimensions, automatically provide a high-quality look. Need a barrier-free bathroom? Choose
            non-slip tiles with a textured surface.
        </p>
        <p>Combining natural materials has a particularly cozy effect. Wood grain combined with natural stones like
            marble makes an impression that is both luxurious and cozy. You can use wood on both the floor and wall
            surfaces.

        </p>
        <p>A sink base cabinet, like a mirror cabinet in a small bathroom, is one of those ideas that have proven
            themselves many times over. You can also create storage space with some skillful wall surface design. A
            shelf embedded in the wall, wall cabinets, and a cabinet under a sloping roof can increase the available
            space enormously.

        </p>
        <p>
            Tidiness is especially important in a small bathroom, as every object lying around gives off the sense of a
            lack of space. Here, too, you can get inspiration from our article about order in the bathroom!
        </p>
        <h2>Design small bathrooms using laws of perception</h2>
        <p>In addition to ideas, designing a small bathroom requires knowledge of the basics of human perception. Bright
            colors, mirrors, and contiguous surfaces immediately make a bathroom with limited space look bigger. Optimal
            lighting, ideally through smart lights, high-quality materials, and skillful integration of storage space
            are other factors in a small bathroom that excites and inspires.

        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Modern luxury bathroom interior design is not just about spending more money and adding irrelevant
            embellishments. It is about space planning, choice of furnishings and fittings, and how all these actions
            are executed. The idea is to mix and match vintage elements with contemporary design concepts, and also to
            exploit materials which are rich to look and feel. De-cluttering is yet another factor which simply cannot
            be ignored. A minimalistic bedroom is in itself a symbol of “Luxury”.
